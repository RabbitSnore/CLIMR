So when choosing the names for young men and women, I tried to choose names that are not associated with the elderly and are also not unique to the 2000s and after. But I should note that the younger names I suggested usually hint at a certain social class and worldview because, as I said, traditional names were as popular in the 90s as they were in the past.

(2019). Perceived biological and social characteristics of a representative set of German first names. Social Psychology.

This corpus contains 2000 names from German media, rated on various dimensions. 
I used the R-data provided with the publication, filtered for occurrences (to filter out very unusual names), filtered for very gender-specific or very unisex-ness and also for rated age and also filtered out names that were considered ageless (=good across time).

My filter for old names was: 
names.mean %>% filter(sum_newscrawl > 1000) %>% filter(abs(Sex_weighted_mean) > 5) %>% filter(is_Ageless_mean < 0.3) %>% filter(Age_mean > 4.5 & Age_mean < 5.0)
This yielded 51 names, from which I selected 6 male and 6 female names that seemed suitable to me. 

My filter for young names was: 
names.mean %>% filter(sum_newscrawl > 700 & Nationality_mean > 0.2) %>% filter(abs(Sex_weighted_mean) > 5) %>% filter(is_Ageless_mean < 0.55) %>% filter(Age_mean > 1.5 & Age_mean < 3.2)
This yielded 65 names from which I selected 12. 

For unisex names my filter was: 
names.mean %>% filter(sum_newscrawl>500) %>% filter(abs(Sex_mean) < 0.5 & abs(Sex_weighted_mean) < 3)
This resulted in 35 names, from which I chose 6.

Note: I would only tally common names that had the same spelling (ex. I considered the name “Maddie” to be separate from “Madeline, Madelyn, and Madison”). 

Upon finding the top 10 common names of the male and female category in each class, I would proceed to take the top 6 common names for each class and tally them all together to generate the final list of common young names that were specific to our lab (i.e. I combined the results of the classes of ‘24-'27 to find the top 6 common names at our respective site). 

Note: Under the circumstance that two names ended up with an equal total, my back-up procedure would be to flip a coin via Google to determine which name received priority in ranking.

With regards to obtaining the list of older and unisex names, I was able to obtain the list of the most popular male and female names during the 1960s in PA via ""ssa.gov"" (https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/namesbystate.cgi). The names were listed in ranking order, therefore I chose the top 6 for each category to include in the older name list. With regards to acquiring the unisex list of names, I used a website called ""babynames.net"" that included the most popular unisex names during the 1960s and I chose the first 6 unisex names that appeared on the list (https://babynames.net/popular/top-1960s?page=6).",

- In the Female older condition, the name ""Karen"" was in the top 6 list, which is emotionally/politically charged in the United States. For this reason, I excluded it and went with the 7th most common name.
For the unisex names, I pulled from a fivethirtyeight blog post that used the same Social Security Administration data and classified the most common unisex names over the past 100 years (ending in 2013). Their criteria was at least 1/3 of each biological sex was given that name, I increased that criteria to at least 40% (given that some of the names seemed less unisex).",
