"s_mancheck_d","numeric","As a final task, please take a moment and imagine that you have moved to a new place just outside of Los Angeles, over 1930 miles away.  

Places can feel close to or far away from ourselves in a psychological sense. Places that feel like they are close to where you are, are said to be “spatially close”. In contrast, places that feel like they are very far away, are said to be “spatially distant”.

To what extent does a place located outside of Los Angeles, over 1930 miles away, feel spatially close or distant?"
