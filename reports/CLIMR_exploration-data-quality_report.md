# Impact of Excluding Samples Based on the Rate of Comprehension Check Failures

## Excluding samples

The figure below can be interpreted as follows: The y-axis indicates the
required rate of participants passing the comprehension check in order
to be included in the analyses. Thus, the higher on the y-axis, the
stricter the criterion. Each point represents the meta-analytic point
estimate after the exclusions. Error bars represent 95% confidence
intervals. Sample sizes are provided on the left side of the plot. A
dotted vertical line is drawn at zero.

## Removing cases at an individual level also

The following figure can be interpreted the same as above, but in these
data, individual participants failing the comprehension check were also
excluded.
