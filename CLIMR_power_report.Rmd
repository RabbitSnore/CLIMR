# Power Analyses for Each Replication

## Liberman & Trope (1998, Study 1)

### What sample sizes are needed for 80% and 95% power to detect the replication effect?

```

```{r}
power_95_n_temporal
```

### What proportion of effects for which previous experiments had 80% power is the replication effect smaller than?

```{r}
smaller_prop_temporal

### What is the median power for the replication effect that the previous experiments samples provided?

```{r}
median_power_temporal
